I joined the SCREAM JAM 2024 with a few friends, and we created this Halloween-themed game where you walk around with others and try to collect as much candy as possible.

My main contributions were:</p><div class='list-container'><ul><li>Developed responsive player controls</li><li>Implemented online multiplayer using Photon Fusion 2</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Platform:</strong> PC</li><li><strong>Engine:</strong> Unity</li></ul></div>",
